### **_About Reviewr_**

Reviewr is a music social networking site built around user generated reviews written by normal people, for normal people. It's a one site stop to listen, rate, and write about the albums you love (and critique the ones you don't).

After creating an account, users can see a feed of all the reviews that have been recently posted. They can search for any exiting album, rate it on a scale from one to ten, and add their thoughts in under 255 characters. If a reviewer changes their mind, they can update their entry. If you like another review, you can click on that person's username and read everything they've contributed to the site.

Overall, Reviewr is about community, hot-takes, and discovering new music.
